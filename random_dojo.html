<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why, and for Whom?</h3>
<p>One of my Krav Maga instructors needed it. I make no claims that anyone else will find it useful or correct. <strong><em>Use at your own risk!</em></strong></p>

<h3>How does the Cooldown feature work?</h3>
<p>The page always remembers the name of every skill it has selected since the page was last reloaded. If you have selected to disallow repeats for <em>x</em> turns, skills chosen up to <em>x</em> turns ago will be locked out. Changing this setting does not affect memory. If you turn it on and disallow the last <em>x</em> turns' worth of skills, and those skills themselves include some repeats, fewer than <em>x</em> skills will be locked out at first.

<h3>Would you consider adding?...</h3>
<p>No. But you can. The page source and Javascript are fully visible, so make your own, Grasshopper.</p>

<h3>This is awesome! How can I thank you?</h3>
<p>A couple things. If you're using this on <a href="https://jenniferneff.com">jenniferneff.com</a>, I pay for that site per refresh, not per month the page exists. So if you have your own space to host it on, you can host your own version. As a bonus, you'll be able to tailor it to your own needs.</p>
<p>If you were looking for a tip jar, donate to <a href="https://350.org">someone fighting climate change</a> instead.</p>
